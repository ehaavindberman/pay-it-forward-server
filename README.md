# Pay it forward server

Server side of a social network for sharing recommendations built with MERNG (MongoDB, Express, React, Node, Graphql) stack. Big thank you to Classed and freeCodeCamp for the great initial tutorial I followed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1mdAPFq2Os).

See [pay-it-forward-client](https://github.com/ehaavindberman/pay-it-forward-client) for setup info.
